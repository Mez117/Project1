# Car database
I have created a database aimed to provide users with a user friendly website which incorporates all the most important things related to cars. The purpose of this website is to allow users to add companies, engines and cars associated with one another to form an organised database. This project is in need of some polishing as the style could be majorly improved and I would like to add a page which shows all cars which users have made.

## :page_facing_up: About
A library of cars for enthusiasts to explore

## :question: How to Use
- Create an account on the sign up page using any email and any password
- Once you've signed up you will already be logged in and have the ability to log out if you wish
- Whenever you log out you can sign back in using an account you created or make a new account
- It will direct you to all cars page which will currently have no data
- Using the hamburger drop down navigation bar, you can create a new car to add to your database or check the engines and manufacturers data base
- You can create new engines and manufacturers, and edit pre-existing ones
- Each Car/manufacturer/engine page will show you all the variables that currently exist and by clicking on the image of that variable you can see more details on the next page.

## :cockroach: Bugs to fix
